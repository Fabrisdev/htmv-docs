# Static files
Having your views is nice and all... but what about images? videos? or maybe you would like to not have to use `<style>` for CSS and `<script>` for your JS.

For this, you can just add any **static files** onto the `public` folder and they will be automatically served at `/public`. Take that into account when importing them inside your `view`.
