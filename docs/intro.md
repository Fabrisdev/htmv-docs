# Installation

:::danger[Precautions]

HTMV currently only works on Bun. Routing on Node.js is broken. Please take note and only use Bun with it while I'm working on Node.js support.

:::

# Getting started
It's simple! Just use htmv's CLI!
```bash
bunx htmv@latest new my_cool_project
```
This will create an htmv project on the folder `my_cool_project`. Finally `cd` into it to get started. Dependencies are already installed. No need for a `bun install`.
