# Understanding the project structure
Before coding, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with HTMV's default project structure.

:::note Irrelevant items
These are items you usually don’t need to interact with.
- `node_modules`  
  Contains project dependencies installed by the package manager.  
  You should not edit files here manually.
- `gitignore`  
  Contains the names of every file [Git](https://git-scm.com/) should not track. It's already been configured, so you shouldn't need to edit it.
- `bun.lock`  
  Automatically generated by Bun. No need to touch it.
- `README.md`  
  Automatically generated by Bun. May get removed in the future.
- `tsconfig.json`  
  Configures how Typescript will get compiled. It's already been configured, so you shouldn't need to edit it.

:::tip Important items
These are items you might find useful.
- `public`  
  Any files put here will be served at `/public/`. This is useful for static files such as images, javascript code, CSS styles, and others.
- `routes`  
  All your routes will be defined inside here.
- `views`  
  All your views/components will be defined inside here.
- `index.ts`  
  Your main entry point and the file which both configures and wakes up HTMV.  
  You can run it with `bun dev`.
- `package.json`  
  Defines the project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.  
  This is where you add or update packages and configure project scripts.
