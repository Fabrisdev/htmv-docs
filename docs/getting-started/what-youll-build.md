# What you'll build
During this tutorial we'll be building our first **TODO list CRUD** app to familiarize you with all of HTMV's concepts and features.
Our app will be able to:
1. List current and completed tasks titles and descriptions
2. Create and store in a database our tasks
3. Delete completed tasks

## After building it
After this tutorial, you should be able to try and add **updating tasks** into it. If you're feeling like trying a challenge, give it a try!

## Got lost? Something isn't working?
The whole code for this tutorial is available on [GitHub](#). Go give it a read if you're lost or even shoot me an issue on [HTMV's docs repo](#) if you think the tutorial was too hard to follow! Feedback is always welcome.
