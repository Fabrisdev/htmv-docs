# What is HTMV?

HTMV is a web framework for server-side rendering. It features an HTML-like templating system which lets you
easily build fast and safely due to how explicit it is. You know all the data passed, no hidden secrets.
Opposite to other web frameworks, no code evaluation is allowed leading to safer code in the end.

Features:
- 0 javascript sent by default to the client.
- Simplicity.
- No hidden secrets.
