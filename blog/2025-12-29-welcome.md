# Welcome
This blog post is a welcoming into HTMV's new documentation site + some general information.
If you wish to keep reading, please click on it.
<!-- truncate -->
As you may already know, HTMV is currently under heavy development.
Expect out of date documentation, bugs, and not-so-good performance.

This will all improve as HTMV progressively stabilizes.

If you're here, **thank you** for your interesting in alpha testing HTMV.
Both suggestions and contributions are greatly welcomed! You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fabrisdev/htmv) and from there we can talk.
